This sunday Johann Strauss delivered a tasty track, complete with sfx, and as everything came together we noticed a few things which needed to be adressed. We decided to make things go faster, and also make some improvements to our goblin model.</p><p>You can see the result for yourself :)</p><p><img src="/images/before-after.png" alt="alt"><br>The left picture is the after picture..</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, we thought an explanation was in order, more so than &quot;We are making a game about short green people&quot;!</p><p>Goblin Insurrection is a puzzle game with many systemic elements! Puzzles are more similar to Legend of Zelda than the original Lemmings, but the player will use whatever items, or orders they have to control the rebel greenskins, as in Lemmings.<br>When traversing the caverns, to overcome obstacles you will have to operate old machines, like: lifts, drills, and bridges, to clear or make your way. You will have to burn obstacles to ash, and fill deep pits with water to swim across. Every time you finish a puzzle, we hope to deliver a genuine &quot;aha&quot; experience!</p><p>Apart from the classic puzzle elements, Goblin Insurrection will also feature elements of exploration, which is rewarded with loot! While the level in itself will be lit and visible, some areas will be hidden behind the fog of war.<br>While exploring, the goblins will find important items required to free their kin from oppression!</p><p>For the completionist, players have a reason to replay levels of Goblin Insurrection to make sure their brethren are saved.<br>The path to freedom is not a straight line! Found a key? Go back a few levels and replay the one with the locked door, rescue the poor sob on the other side!</p><p>These are features we have now, or those about to be implemented shortly.<br>As any other game developer we of course also have bigger plans. Creating a storyline, and making a map editor are only two of them, but first things first!</p><p><img src="/images/81094315_502295990485451_4678990586907197440_n.gif" alt="alt"><br><img src="/images/84345592_608713669921737_1225604424408236032_n.gif" alt="alt"></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As of now we are working hard at creating a trailer for Goblin Insurrection for our planned Fig campaign! For myself, its mostly catering to the required animations and assets required, while Daniel is grinding away at creating the environments, timings, camera pans etc.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Sweden, Johann Strauss is composing a very crisp cinematic track. If all goes as planned, the campaign will launch somewhere in the middle of March, but the trailer will be available here in just a few days!</p><p>It is really satisfying to see Goblin Insurrection take shape, and adding music to the visuals especially fuels the development!</p><p>Until next week, have some Goblin propaganda!</p><p><img src="/images/propaganda.png" alt="alt"></p>]]></content:encoded>

If this is at the top of the page, this means you are special to us, and should give yourself a tap on the shoulder!<br>We make games! :)<br>As of now, we are hard at work on Goblin Insurrection, a puzzler game inspired by Lemmings, and Zelda. Our first title, Dantes Bullet Inferno is anxiously resting on the shelf as administrative tasks prove a bottleneck for us, although we will be pushing it to Steam in the near future!</p><p>We hope to post here at least weekly. We certainly hope you find it interesting!</p>]]></content:encoded>
